# History-Creative-Project

An incredibly stupid shooting game for HISTORY CLASS goddamn it what's wrong with me with absolutely unbearable code put together within 2 weeks of heavy procrastination and pain if anyone looks at this congratulations you have polluted your eyes and maybe this will help you understand what happens when you try to finish a game on the last day before the due date and hand in an absolute mess like this one. 

Most of the art made by me which is why most of it looks terrible except the base character which came from kenney.nl of course it did where else could I get art that looks decent without my teacher finding out that I used copyrighted material and deduct 10% of the marks. 

If you want to use any code from this DON'T if you want to use any art from this DON'T if you want to draw any inspiration from this DON'T if you want SHUT UP AND GET A LIFE THIS IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.
